I am Jiaji Ma, a first-year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student in the [Graph Exploration and Mining at Scale (GEMS) lab](https://gemslab.github.io/) at The University of Michigan, advised by Professor [Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/). 
My research focuses on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). 

Before my PhD, I earned my BS in Computer Science and BA in Applied Statistics from The University of Virginia in 2024.
